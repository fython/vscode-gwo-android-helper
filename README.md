Gwo Android Helper
======

Browse files on your Android devices with Visual Studio Code

## Requirements

- Visual Studio Code 1.53+
- Android Debug Bridge (should be in `$PATH`)

# What can it do?

- Operate files on your Android devices in file manager tab just like your local files.
- Open adb shell in terminal tab

I develop this extension for managing my files between phone and computer. Without building a new program, using Visual Studio Code as a UI & file manager framework/platform saves a lot of time. So we didn't need to do much work for adapting project to different OS.

## Usage

1. Install extension from marketplace or compile by yourself: Gwo Android Helper
2. Click "Gwo Android Helper" tab in side bar
3. Find out your device and click "Open internal storage" (or choose other actions)
4. Switch back to "File explorer" tab and you can see device storage in current workspace
